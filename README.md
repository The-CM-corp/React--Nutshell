# React Nutshell
Nutshell is a new app that provides everything a user could need, all in one nice shell. The app provides a way for users to keep track of their daily tasks, chat with other users, and share news articles and events. Nutshell is written using the React framework.

# Getting Started
To run Nutshell locally, create an empty directory and clone the project by running the following command in your terminal: ```git@github.com:The-CM-corp/React--Nutshell.git```

Nutshell uses a database.json file to store all data. To create the database, run:
```
mkdir api
cd api
touch nutshell.json
```


Open **database.json** and copy the following into the file to create a database skeleton:
